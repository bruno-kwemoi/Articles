# Introduction to APIs

In the modern day technology devices are required to work together for efficiency, but have you ever wondered how they communicate yet they are written in different languages and built in different architectures? Well, that’s where APIs come in. APIs help programs to talk to each other no matter what language they are written in. In this article, we will dive into the world of APIs and understand how they are valuable to our programs and how they can help us unleash our creativity.

## What is an API?

To understand what an API is in the most simple terms, we will think of it this way: when you go to the restaurant you interact with the waiter to order your food and pay for it, the waiter is the interface between you and the restaurant; you don’t have to know who the chef is or what kind of ovens they use. In this case, the waiter is an API for the restaurant. Similarly, an API acts as a translator that enables different programs to communicate with each other. It stands for Application Programmable Interface, and there are different types of APIs that serve different purposes.

## Getting Data from Third Parties

One of the most powerful applications of APIs is the ability to get data from third parties. In the restaurant example, the waiter can give you the status of your food without you having to go to the kitchen to check for yourself. Similarly, in the case of a weather update you receive on your phone, Google hasn’t manually placed sensors around the world. Instead, they use APIs from third-party sources like The Weather Channel. There are APIs to lookup for lyrics, recipes, information on barcodes, available parking spaces, and much more.

## Hiding Complexity and Performing Tasks

APIs can also be used to hide complexity and perform tasks. In our restaurant example, you don’t have to know how to make pizza, you just have to order one. Similarly, the social media app doesn’t have to know how to take a picture for your profile picture, instead Android provides developers with a bunch of APIs that perform the selected tasks. If an app wants to show a button, it just asks the system to render one; the app doesn’t have to know what system it is running on or what hardware it has.

## Extending Functionality

APIs can also be used to extend functionality. For example, your Google Home Assistant may not know how to turn your smart plugs on and off, but this changes once your vendor integrates with the Google Assistant through its API, and this extends the functionality of your Google Assistant for it can now turn your smart plugs on and off.
